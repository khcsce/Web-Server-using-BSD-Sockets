CS118 Project 1: Web Server Implementation using BSD Sockets

-The high level design of your server (one paragraph)

I create a client and server connection using two socket file descriptors.
The browser serves as the client. The user has to specify while <file> they want 
by typing in the url localhost:<port_no>/<file>. The <port_no> is specified 
when executable is ran by doing ./webserver <port_no>. The server first
reads the HTTP request, prints out the request to the terminal, parses the request
to determine file_name and file_type. Afterward, the size of the file is determined
and the contents of the file are read into a buffer. Next, the HTML response is done
by printing out the HTTP version and status, the content length of the file, the content type 
by comparing the determined file type and strings like "html", "jpg", etc.Finally,
the contents of the file are printed to the browser for the user to actually see.

Example compililation and runnning:
make
./webserver 5334

// In the browser, type in the url:

localhost:5334/file.txt

-The problems you ran into and how you solved the problems (up to three paragraphs)

All my files were being treated as binary files even though some had extentsions.
I examined my code where I did the string parsing for the type of contents. Finally, 
I found out that I didn't if have an else condition for where the extensions of files
didn't match html,htm,jpeg,jpg,and gif.
Another problem I had was that my images and binary files worked fine, but my html
and txt files didn't show up correctly. I forgot I had to actually read the contents of the file
and not just the HTTP request. Thus, I created a file buffer then used "write" to print out
the contents of the file to the file descriptior. 
I didn't know how to parse the HTTP request to get the filename and file type. Thus, in order
to help myself, I printed out the HTTP request after reading it. After examining the format of the 
request, I determined iterating starting from an index 5 will solve the problem.
